To answer your questions, I need clarification:

What script are you referring to? Are you asking about a specific file or script in the indrasenareddy1/demo20 repository, or about code that was generated by a tool (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)?
If you are asking about modifications, please specify which script or file you mean.
Could you clarify which script or code you are referring to? This will help me provide accurate details about the code generation, modifications, testing, and instructions for including "how to run the script" in the README.
